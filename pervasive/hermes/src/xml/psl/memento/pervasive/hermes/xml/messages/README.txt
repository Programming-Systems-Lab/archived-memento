This class is used to created all the XML messages.  PVCTDMessage.cs has all
the messages used by both server and client.  This dll was designed to be
used on both the compact framework and the regular .NET framework. So,
if you make changes be sure that any new methods or dlls will be compatible with
both platforms.
