Bush and Blair in Belfast to Discuss Iraq, U.N. and Europe
By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and WARREN HOGE





ELFAST, Northern Ireland, April 7 — President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair turned their attention today to planning for a postwar Iraq, seeking to bridge their differences over how much of a role to give the United Nations in rebuilding the country and putting together a new government.

Mr. Bush flew here tonight for a 20-hour visit with Mr. Blair, his closest ally in confronting Saddam Hussein, to discuss questions made increasingly urgent by the rapid military progress American and British forces have made.

Mr. Blair has been under pressure at home and from much of Europe to support giving the United Nations a strong role in stabilizing Iraq. But the White House has consistently signaled that it wants the United States and Britain to play the lead role in creating a new Iraqi government.

Secretary of State Colin L. Powell told reporters traveling with the president that the United States was sending officials to the region this week to begin assembling a group of Iraqis who would constitute an interim governing authority, which would be put in place alongside American-led military and civilian authorities.

In a sign of the speed with which the maneuvering for power in post-Saddam Iraq is unfolding, Ahmed Chalabi, the leader of the main Iraqi exile opposition group, the Iraqi National Congress, was reported to be heading to Baghdad from southern Iraq.

"The hostilities phase is coming to a conclusion," Mr. Powell said. "It's time for all of us to think about the post-hostilities phase, how we create a representative government consisting of all elements of Iraqi society."

Mr. Powell and British officials played down the magnitude of the differences between the United States and Britain over the United Nations role.

Mr. Powell said the United Nations would have "an endorsing role to play to the interim authority to give it legitimacy," a formulation that appeared to reserve for the United States and Britain the right to select the leaders of the temporary postwar administration.

A spokesman for Mr. Blair used similar language, referring to the United Nations' being involved "in a way that endorses that new Iraqi authority" as a step toward establishing a full-fledged Iraqi government.

Initially, primary responsibility for administering the country would rest with a team led by a retired United States Army general, Jay Garner, and the interim Iraqi authority would be likely to begin assuming power after that, perhaps 90 days later, the British spokesman said.

Clearly wary of getting into another diplomatic squabble with other members of the United Nations Security Council, Mr. Powell and other administration officials have emphasized in recent days that the United States and Britain, having waged the war and paid for it with blood and money, will not be drawn into a negotiation with countries like France and Germany over the immediate postwar period.

But Mr. Powell emphasized today that part of his focus now would be on "healing" diplomatic wounds and granting the United Nations an important role once Iraq is stabilized.

Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, arrived here tonight from Moscow, where she met with President Vladimir V. Putin, who had broken with Mr. Bush over the war but whose country has longstanding economic interests in Iraq, including oil.

At the United Nations, Secretary General Kofi Annan said he would travel to Britain, France, Germany and Russia this week to test whether the Security Council might be able to agree on a postwar plan.

"Above all, the U.N. involvement does bring legitimacy which is necessary, necessary for the country, for the region and for the peoples around the world," Mr. Annan said.

Mr. Bush's trip to see Mr. Blair here was the third Anglo-American summit meeting in as many weeks. It coincided with news that American forces were attacking the presidential palaces and other symbols of the Iraqi government in the heart of Baghdad and that British soldiers had taken control of Iraq's second-largest city, Basra.

The two leaders met at Hillsborough, a castle south of Belfast, and began their sessions with a half-hour walk through the gardens early this evening before dinner. On Tuesday, they will hold a news conference and further talks, including a session on the Northern Ireland peace effort.

The presence of the two leaders drew crowds of antiwar protesters and set off a local debate about whether this city, which has been trying to put behind it a history of sectarian violence, was an appropriate location for a war council. City authorities in Belfast had to divert traffic and clear public buildings in various locations this morning after a series of bomb scares. The scenes were reminiscent of the conflicted time before the 1998 Northern Ireland peace agreement put an end to organized sectarian violence that cost the lives of more than 3,600 people over three decades.

In the conversations about Iraq, Mr. Blair is playing his customary role of trying to bridge trans-Atlantic differences. He hopes to placate criticism at home and ease relations with his European neighbors by pushing for a United Nations resolution authorizing an interim governing authority.

He had earlier envisaged a more prominent role for the United Nations, but he emerged from his last meeting with Mr. Bush, at Camp David on March 27, emphasizing the need for the United Nations to endorse the transition plans rather than play a central part in the plans, as he had advocated at the first summit, in the Azores on March 16.

Europeans have expressed alarm at what they see as the marginalization of the world body. At the same time, European critics of the war, like France, Germany and Russia, may object to Mr. Blair's compromise proposal on grounds that it legitimizes a war they oppose.

Even in Britain, the one European country where the war has majority support, there is great resistance to American domination of the postwar running of Iraq. An opinion poll in today's Daily Telegraph showed that while Britons' enthusiasm for the war had grown to a high of 60 percent and their approval of Mr. Blair's conduct had also risen, there was only 2 percent approval of an American-controlled administration of Iraq.

Mr. Powell said the United States was only trying to lay out a plan under which military control of Iraq could give way to a mix of civilian and military control, including substantial involvement by Iraqis, and then to a full-fledged government.

He said United Nations involvement might be necessary to convince banks and financial markets that they could safely and legally lend money to Iraq. Asked about peacekeeping duties, he said NATO was open to the possibility of helping to provide postwar security or assisting in the search for weapons of mass destruction.

But planning for the peace has exposed differences not only between the United States and Britain, but also within the Bush administration and between the administration and Congress.

Mr. Blair chose to hold his meeting with Mr. Bush in Northern Ireland in part so that the president could lend his support to the long-running efforts by Britain and Ireland to find a peaceful solution to the long-running strife between Catholics and Protestants in the province.

The White House, however, appeared not to be paying much attention to Northern Ireland diplomacy. The schedules and credentials it distributed to reporters here listed the site as "Belfast, Ireland."
