Utilities:
These utilities are used in the server (i.e. utilities do not work on Pocket PC 2002)
for logging, constants, and exceptions.

The Runloop could have been better designed using the ThreadPool managment of C# .NET
but at the time of development I did not know everything that the language offered.
