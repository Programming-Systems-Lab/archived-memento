x Change the SwitchBoard framework to use the new LinkDestination classes

x Fix up DomainAgent class. A DomainAgent shouldn't need to know its own GUID
in order to broadcast notices. Instead, introduce another class, Broadcaster,
which contains the GUID of the source and the topic to broadcast on. Then
code like:
    Notice notice = new Notice();
    notice.setSourceId(this.getGuid());
	notice.setTopicId(this.getDomainTopic());

    could be replaced with code like:

    broadCaster.broadCast(...notification...);
roadcaster object and let it do it's work.
