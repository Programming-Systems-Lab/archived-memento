BELFAST, Northern Ireland (Reuters) - War allies George W. Bush and Tony Blair flew into Northern Ireland on Monday to assess their troops' gains on the battlefield and discuss plans for the leadership of post-conflict Iraq.

The U.S. president's first visit to Belfast was a political payback for the British prime minister, who has stood by him throughout the Iraq crisis and flown twice across the Atlantic for war councils this year.

In an ambitious agenda, Bush and Blair were also to discuss the stalled Middle East and Northern Irish peace processes.

Secretary of State Colin Powell said that Washington would send a team to Iraq this week to begin looking at what is needed to set up an interim Iraqi authority.

Speaking to reporters traveling with Bush, Powell said it was time to start talking about the future of Iraq because the military campaign was going "exceptionally well."

He played down a transatlantic rift over the role the United Nations would play in postwar Iraq. "Let's not fight that fight again. Let's get back to the basic proposition that is before us, and that is to rebuild a country that has been devastated by war and Saddam," said Powell, referring to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.

"We'll be discussing with the Brits tonight...and ultimately with the Security Council, the nature of U.N. resolutions that would lay out what the role of the United Nations would be. There's no question that the United nations will play an important role," Powell said.

INTERIM AUTHORITY

He made clear that the United States hoped to set up quickly an interim Iraqi authority made up of Iraqi exiles and people still living in the country. "We'll be sending people over this week to begin the process of bringing together a group that would constitute the authority," he said.

Powell's remarks indicated a measure of support for London's desire to involve the United Nations in running postwar Iraq to placate anti-war countries like France and Germany, and to appease many Britons who are skeptical of U.S. motives in Iraq.

As Bush and Blair arrived in Belfast, where hoax bomb scares brought chaos to roads and airports, British officials also spelt out their positions on postwar Iraq.

"It is absolutely clear we want to see U.N. authority for the operations there in exactly the way we did in operations in Afghanistan," British Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon said.

Some U.S. officials have ruled out a leading political role for the U.N., saying Washington and its allies have earned the right to call the shots by giving "life and blood." They oppose the idea of the U.N. running an interim government in Iraq as it has in Kosovo, East Timor and Afghanistan.

U.S. National Security Council spokesman Sean McCormack said that Bush still stood behind a statement issued with Blair in the Azores on the eve of war committing Washington to seeking new U.N. Security Council resolutions on Iraq.

They included resolutions to affirm Iraq's territorial integrity, ensure rapid delivery of humanitarian relief, and endorse an "appropriate post-conflict administration."

SUPPORT FOR NORTHERN IRELAND PEACE PLAN

Speaking to reporters in Belfast, McCormack said Bush would use the visit to "lend support" to the peace plan set out by Blair and Irish leader Bertie Ahern for Northern Ireland.

Bush would shortly release the so-called road map for ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but the next step was confirmation of the new Palestinian prime minister, he added.

Bush's visit may help Blair regain lost prestige at home by proving he is not the "poodle" of the White House his critics label him.

The venue -- Hillsborough Castle south of Belfast -- is also designed to give Blair's efforts to revive Northern Ireland's flagging peace process a boost.

Bush's predecessor Bill Clinton got a hero's welcome on his visits to Belfast and helped achieve the 1998 Good Friday accord that set up Northern Ireland's now-suspended home rule. Unlike Clinton, Bush will keep away from the public because of nerves over security and anticipated anti-war protests.

He will meet Irish Prime Minister Ahern and hold brief talks with Northern Ireland leaders on Tuesday.

Several hundred anti-war campaigners from both sides of the Irish border gathered for a protest as Blair and Bush flew in.

"Bush and Blair are not wanted here while they're conducting this war against Iraq," said Richard Boyd Barret, head of the Dublin-based Irish Anti-War Movement, which joined forces with the Northern Irish Stop the War Coalition for the protest.
