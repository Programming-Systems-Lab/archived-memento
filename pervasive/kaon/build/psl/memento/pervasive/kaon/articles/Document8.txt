Hillsborough Castle near Belfast, where US President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair are due to hold a summit.

Barred from approaching the 17th century Georgian manor house, the demonstrators instead made their feelings known in the parking lot of a shopping centre, where journalists covering the summit had converged.

"We're here to express our opposition to the war in Iraq," Bairbre de Brun, the Sinn Fein education minister in the now-suspended Northern Ireland Assembly, said today.

The demonstrators came from all over Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, converging on Hillsborough in a procession of cars and chartered buses about 3km long.

Bush and Blair arrived in the city to take stock of the war and discuss the future of Iraq.

They were to be joined later by Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern to discuss the Northern Ireland peace process.

Hillsborough Castle, the official residence of Britain's secretary of state for Northern Ireland, is about 10km south of Belfast.
