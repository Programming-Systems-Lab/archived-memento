				Every Message will need to keep a number (or string)
				explaining what kind of message it is--Request, Response or
				Notification.

		<reminder date="4/8/03" time="11:44pm EST">
			<text>
                Is it true that every request requires a response? For example,
				when a user is moving around does it make sense to generate
				a response for each of these events even if it's only '200 OK'?
