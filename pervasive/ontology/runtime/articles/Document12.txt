Amid fears Hong Kong's health system could be stretched beyond its limits by a mystery flu-like disease, health officials warned yesterday another big outbreak is possible.

The Hospital Authority said separately it is preparing for a worst-case scenario of 3,000 patients by the end of the month.

Forty-one new cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and one more death were reported in Hong Kong yesterday, raising the worldwide toll to at least 100 people.

Deputy Health Director Dr. Leung Pak-yin said officials were concerned about 24 "sporadic" patients who became infected in ways officials have yet to determine.

If any of those patients has been highly contagious, as a few SARS sufferers have been, Hong Kong could face another worrisome outbreak of the disease, Leung told a news conference.

"If we are not doing our protection well, these sporadic cases could become a source of another outbreak," Leung said. "So we must be careful."

Earlier, Hong Kong's Hospital Authority chairman Leong Che-hung said officials were preparing for a worst-case scenario of 3,000 people being treated for SARS by the end of April.

Dr. Lo Wing-lok, an infectious disease expert and lawmaker, said Sunday that Hong Kong's hospitals can only handle about 1,500 SARS patients, or a little more than twice the 700 or so now in the hospital.

Leung also said that of more than 240 people removed from an infected apartment building and placed in makeshift quarantine camps, 16 were found to carry the virus that causes SARS but showed no symptoms. He did not say whether those people were contagious but said they were being treated and would not be released for now.

China yesterday reported another death from SARS and revealed that fatalities in recent weeks have been much more widespread than previously reported.

In the country's south, international experts were looking into whether the mystery disease might have come from animals on farms or in the wild.

Also yesterday, the Beijing office of the Geneva-based International Labor Organization was sealed, and an employee of the diplomatic office building said it was disinfected after a Finnish official of the agency fell ill with SARS in Beijing. The official died Sunday.

The report came as World Health Organization experts who are searching Guangdong for clues as to how SARS spreads and why it kills were looking into whether it might have come from animals. China last week granted WHO its first visit to the region since the outbreak surfaced there in November.

"Atypical pneumonia is a disaster. There is no precedence for something like this," said Huang Huahua, the governor of Guangdong, who met yesterday afternoon with the WHO experts.

The team in Guangdong hasn't found any evidence yet to support that widely-discussed possibility, said team leader Dr. Robert Breiman. He said they met with local animal-health officials and discussed both farm animals and wildlife, including pigs, ducks, bats, rodents, chickens and other birds.

Experts have linked SARS to a new form of coronavirus, other forms of which usually are found in animals.

That link "may suggest that it originates from animals," Breiman said. However, he said, "the discussions today were inconclusive, so we really don't have clues."

In Singaporem, two more people died from SARS yesterday, bringing the death toll in the city-state to eight, the health ministry said.

Six nurses were also reported to have severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, raising fears that the illness is spreading across hospitals in the small city-state despite strict quarantine measures.

Yesterday's victims included the mother of Esther Mok, one of Singapore's first SARS patients, said Bey Mui Leng, a health ministry spokeswoman. Mok is believed to have brought SARS to the city-state following a trip to Hong Kong in February.

Australia yesterday added SARS to its list of diseases requiring quarantine, ranking the illness as dangerous as cholera and smallpox.

The step gives authorities the right to isolate any suspected sufferers of SARS, if it is against their will, and paves the way for the closure of schools, public places and borders if needed.

A spokeswoman for Health Minister Kay Patterson said although state health authorities already have the power to quarantine infectious patients, it was considered "prudent" to add SARS to federal quarantine legislation before any future need.

"This will take effect immediately," said the spokeswoman.
