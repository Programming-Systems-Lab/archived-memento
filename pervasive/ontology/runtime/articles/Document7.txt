High Security, and Hope, Greet Bush in N.Ireland

BELFAST (Reuters) - Northern Ireland, a weary veteran of high security and dashed hopes, greeted President Bush on Monday with steel barriers but also fresh optimism that he can help kickstart the peace process.

The president arrived at Hillsborough Castle, south of Belfast, on Monday night for a summit meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair that will focus chiefly on the war in Iraq.

But there were also hopes that his first personal intervention could breathe new life into the British-ruled province's flagging peace process -- and pile fresh pressure on the Irish Republican Army to renounce violence for good.

U.S. National Security Council spokesman Sean McCormack said Bush would "lend support" to the peace initiative Blair and his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern plan to launch later in the week.

"The president's coming here to engage on this issue and also to be supportive of Prime Ministers Blair and Ahern's efforts," McCormack told reporters.

Bush has a tough act to follow. His predecessor Bill Clinton brought cheering crowds to the streets and was instrumental in achieving the 1998 Good Friday peace accord on his previous visits to Northern Ireland.

Bush won an enthusiastic reception when he went on an impromptu walkabout to meet around 200 families of British service personnel who had turned out to see Air Force One touch down at a military airbase outside Belfast.

But on the outskirts of Hillsborough, several hundred anti-war demonstrators staged a sit-down protest in front of a line of riot police who prevented them getting within a mile of the summit venue.

In the picturesque village itself steel barricades had been erected round the Georgian castle, Queen Elizabeth's official residence in the province.

Blair and Ahern will return to Belfast on Thursday, the fifth calendar anniversary of the Good Friday deal, to present their blueprint for restoring the power-sharing government set up by the landmark accord.

The Protestant/Catholic assembly, intended to end three decades of conflict, has been suspended since allegations of IRA spying erupted last October.

London and Dublin hope the high-profile U.S. involvement will help persuade rival leaders to sign up to their plan, and, crucially, add to the pressure on the IRA to respond quickly by declaring its guerrilla war against British rule over.

Briefing journalists at a Belfast hotel soon after Bush arrived at the summit, Blair's official spokesman said the president's presence in Northern Ireland "speaks volumes" for the U.S. commitment to the peace process.

He said the president shared Blair's belief that Northern Ireland -- which despite endless political wrangles has seen a sharp drop in violence in recent years -- could act as a model for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

"What Northern Ireland shows is -- if determination and commitment is shown, progress can be made over time," the spokesman said.

Ahern will join the two other leaders at Hillsborough on Tuesday morning, when Bush will meet Northern Ireland's key political players.
