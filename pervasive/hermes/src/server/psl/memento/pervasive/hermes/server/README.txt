First thing first after opening the PVCServer you need to set the ServerTest project
as the startup project. Right click on ServerTest and hit the set as start up project
tab.

After that you should be able to startup the project.

The Server has three main components:  The PVCServer where managment of the server
happens.  ClientHelp where each client is helped with request and sent messages.
And the ChatHelper where chat request and ongoing chats are handled.
