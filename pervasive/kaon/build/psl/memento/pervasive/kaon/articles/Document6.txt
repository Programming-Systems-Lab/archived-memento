Bush flies in to Belfast as Blair urges UN role for Iraq

Tony Blair urged George Bush last night to allow the United Nations to appoint an interim Iraqi-run authority once the war against Saddam Hussein is over.

President Bush arrived in Belfast on a two-day visit to discuss Iraq, the Middle East and Northern Ireland. The talks in Hillsborough Castle marked his third summit with Mr Blair in less than a month. With the Iraqi regime appearing to be collapsing, the two leaders discussed strategy for the final stages of the conflict but much of their talks centred on a post-Saddam administration.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: "The first thing they did was to go for a walk in the gardens for about half an hour. It's much more like a Camp David-style meeting. The key is informality, to try and have as reflective a discussion as possible."

The Pentagon is keen to keep the UN's role in Iraq to a minimum and is insisting on a dominant role for a US military team headed by retired US Army Lieutenant-General Jay Garner. Mr Blair proposed a compromise plan, which would allow a UN-backed Iraqi Interim Authority (IIA) to run alongside the US administration after two months.

According to senior government sources, the IIA would then take over fully from the US six months after the end of the war. It would run the country until proper elections could be arranged. The plan for parallel US and Iraqi administrations is seen in Downing Street as an innovative way of squaring the circle of American concerns over security with British insistence on a important UN role.

Mr Blair and Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, have already called for a UN-convened conference of Iraqi groups before the creation of the interim authority.

The two leaders also discussed the detailed publication of the long-awaited "road-map" for the Middle East, which would create a Palestinian state by 2005.

The Northern Ireland peace process was another part of the talks. "The governments are nearly ready to put our proposals to the parties," the Prime Minister's spokesman said. "But I think it is a mistake to talk about a done deal."

Bertie Ahern, the Taoiseach, who will join Mr Blair and Mr Bush for talks on the Ulster peace process today, insisted that a new Iraqi administration would have "greater legitimacy" if it was clearly under the ambit of the international community, adding that the Irish government wanted to see the UN "at the heart of that".

While some in Washington argue that Iraq's potentially massive oil wealth should be tapped for its reconstruction, London argues that funds from the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and European Union will be required urgently and that a UN mandate is the only way to secure that. Mr Blair's official spokesman said yesterday that the UN should have "a leading role".

Hillsborough Castle was cordoned off to keep away thousands of anti-war protesters.

At a protest rally near Hillsborough the Sinn Fein chairman, Mitchel McLaughlin, was booed because his party had agreed to meet Mr Bush today.

Mr Bush, Mr Blair and Mr Ahern will urge Northern Ireland parties today to finalise a deal, which has been the subject of intricate negotiation for months. On Thursday, the fifth anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, Mr Ahern will return to Northern Ireland with Mr Blair. They are due to publish a blueprint intended to produce a significant IRA response on the issue of weaponry.

The success of these moves, possibly over the next few weeks, would be highly welcome to Mr Blair, in particular in demonstrating to his critics a continuing commitment to tackling conflicts by negotiation.
